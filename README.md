# utils

This repository contains small utilities I wrote for my own use; I distribute
them in the hope they may be useful to others.

* ascii -- ASCII Table generator.  You can pass it a single character as a
  command argument and it will just print the details for that character.
  Passing the option --in-order will show a table of values from 32 - 126 in
  order.  Passing no arguments will show the same range of characters grouped
  by type.
